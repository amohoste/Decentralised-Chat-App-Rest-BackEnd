# Decentralised Chat App
Project for the course Webdevelopment (C003779) | 2nd sem 2017 - 2018. Made during my second year of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Ghent University.

Made a decentralised Chat App.

## Implementations
- [Linked Front End](https://github.com/amohoste/Decentralised-Chat-App-Linked-FrontEnd): Front End Version (VueJS) using Linked Data. Also uses Linked Data Fragments.
- [Linked Back End](https://github.com/amohoste/Decentralised-Chat-App-Linked-BackEnd): Back End Version (NodeJS, Express) using Linked Data. Also uses Linked Data Fragments.
- Back End Rest (this): Back End Version (NodeJS, Express) expecting a Rest Api as the users data storage.
